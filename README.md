# Firebase vs Supabase vs AWS Amplify

| Feature / Service        | **Firebase** (Google) | **Supabase** (Open-source) | **AWS Amplify** (Amazon) |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Database**             | Firestore (NoSQL, real-time) | PostgreSQL (SQL, relational, real-time) | DynamoDB (NoSQL) or AppSync (GraphQL with multiple DBs) |
| **Authentication**       | Built-in (email, social, custom providers) | Built-in (email, social, magic links) | AWS Cognito (more complex, but powerful) |
| **File Storage**         | Cloud Storage (scalable, global) | S3-compatible storage (managed buckets) | S3 (scalable, enterprise-level) |
| **Hosting**              | Static site hosting + CDN (very simple to set up) | Basic hosting (not primary focus, often paired with Netlify/Vercel) | Amplify Hosting (connected to GitHub, CI/CD support) |
| **APIs**                 | Firebase SDKs, REST APIs | REST & auto-generated GraphQL APIs | REST & GraphQL (AppSync) |
| **Serverless Functions** | Cloud Functions (integrated with Google Cloud) | Supabase Edge Functions (powered by Deno) | AWS Lambda (full AWS ecosystem, steep learning curve) |
| **Ease of Use**          | Very beginner-friendly, excellent docs, great for small/medium apps | Beginner-friendly, especially if you know SQL | Steeper learning curve, more setup needed, enterprise focus |
| **Pricing**              | Free tier + pay-as-you-go (can get expensive at scale) | Generous free tier, usage-based pricing | Free tier + pay-as-you-go (enterprise pricing, can scale huge) |
| **Open Source?**         | ‚ùå Proprietary (Google-owned) | ‚úÖ 100% open source | ‚ùå Proprietary (Amazon-owned) |
| **Best For**             | Prototyping, small/medium apps, mobile/web apps | Projects needing SQL & self-hosting, developer-friendly | Enterprise-scale apps needing AWS ecosystem integration |
